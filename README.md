# VT-clicks
Automated web browsing backed by the selenium to instantly click on instant opportunities in the Varsity Tutors dashboard

## Step 1. 
Make sure you have python installed on your computer. General download instruction can be found at [Geeks for Geeks] (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/download-and-install-python-3-latest-version/)

## Step 2.
This script requires a variety of basic packages (i.e. requests) which will need to be installation. 
Selenium also requires a chromedriver to be installed in a specfic location on the computer. 
Easy instructions for mac can be found at [Sam Wilson's TILs] (https://til.simonwillison.net/selenium/selenium-python-macos).

## Step 3.
Once you have the necessary software, the python script can be run on your local computer. 
Download the vtinstabot.py file and make sure to put in your username and password.
Run the script from terminal or command line (for mac, this looks like `python3 vtinstabot.py`)

## Step 4.
When running the automation, please make sure that you are still reviewing the description of the opportunities.
There is a built in 15 second window to make sure you do this for instant opportunities.
The goal is click faster not click blindly.

## Step 5. 
Once you find an instant opportunity, DO NOT stop the program. 
This will close the automated browswer and you will lose your session.
